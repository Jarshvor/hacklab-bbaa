## History

HACKLAB Bellas Artes started its journey as a space for inter-faculty/student collaboration, research, and proyect management in the realm of technology and digital fabrication.

Today we formalize this activity in the form of a PIMCD, Proyecto de Innovaci√≥n.

In the future we wish to involve even more and be more officially engrained within the faculty structure as well as the university community as a whole.


## Ethos

At HackLAB we strive to encourge an atmosphere of open and proactive collaboration. We believe in the importance of creating an environment where knowledge is shared, and where it is collectively cared for and put in service of advancing our common goals.


## Goals

- To enable the critical and proficient adoption of new technology within our field. (and means of digital fabrication and production within the field of Fine Art, Design, and Cultural Heritage and Restoration.
- The advancement of certain areas of research under our purvey.
- To provide a space (both physical, virtual, and conceptual) that allows for 
-  
- To collaborate in the development of proyects that would otherwise not be feasable or achievable from the effort of one idividual or area of expertise.
- To facilitate creative and working synergies amongst our members and the public, where the latter increasingly become the former.
