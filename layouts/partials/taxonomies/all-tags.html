<!--

The following code:
- Sets a manually configured variable as the $taxonomy.
- Prints the name of the taxonomy (Tags:)
- Gets the .Page objects into the $tags variable.
- Creates an empty slice.
- ranges over the .Page objects ($tags) using the $tag variable
- and for each iteration sets the $link as the /$taxonomy/ and the /$tag Title. Then urlizes it.
- also for each iteration it appends to the $tagLinks "array?" the href anchor with the $link and the $tag Title.
- It also counts the pages for each $tag.
- We now have to consider sorting of the terms in the taxonomy: alphabetically, by count, by custom relationship (materials).
